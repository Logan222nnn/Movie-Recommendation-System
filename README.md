## Model Development Process

**1. Data Preprocessing**

- Started with 4,800+ movie records
- Cleaned and processed to 1,500 high-quality entries
- Combined genres, keywords, overviews, and taglines for analysis

**2. Feature Engineering**

- Applied TF-IDF vectorization for text analysis
- Created 2,000-dimensional feature space
- Optimized for content-based similarity matching

**3. Similarity Calculation**

- Computed cosine similarity between all movies
- Built similarity matrix for instant recommendations
- Optimized for fast real-time predictions

**4. API Integration**

- Connected with OMDB API for real-time movie data
- Added poster images, ratings, and cast information
- Implemented fallback handling for missing data


## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sankaran-s2001/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Setup API key**

- Get free API key from [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
- Copy `config_template.json` to `config.json`
- Add your API key to `config.json`

4. **Run preprocessing** (first time only)
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

5. **Start the application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

6. **Open in browser** - Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
